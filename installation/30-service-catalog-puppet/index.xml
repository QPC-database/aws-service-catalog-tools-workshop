      <description>You can use Service Catalog Puppet with AWS Organizations. Using it will allow you describe all accounts within an organizational unit as a single entity. This provides a quicker way to get started and an easier way of managing multiple account environments.
If you do not want to use Organizations please skip to the next section of this how to.
What are we going to do? When enabling AWS Organizations you will need to provision an IAM Role in the Organizations master account and you will then need to provide the ARN of that role to your puppet account as an AWS SSM parameter.</description>
