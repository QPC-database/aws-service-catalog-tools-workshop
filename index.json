AWS Service Catalog allows you to centrally manage commonly deployed IT services, and helps you achieve consistent governance and meet your compliance requirements, while enabling users to quickly deploy only the approved IT services they need.\n NOTE: Whilst this Workshop makes use of AWS Service Catalog, the primary goal is to learn how to use a suite of open source tools created to compliment the native AWS service.\n "

You will also need to decide which account to install these tools into.\nThis account will contain the AWS CodePipelines and will need to be accessible to any accounts you would like to share products with. If you want to use the optional AWS Organizations support you will need to install the tools into an account where there is (or can be) a trust relationship with the Organizations master account. You can install these tools into your master account but this is not recommended.\nBoth tools should be installed into the same region of the same account.\nTask list Here:\n Service Catalog Factory   Service Catalog Puppet   "

You specify where in git the source code is for your products and you specify which regions you would like your products to exist and the framework will perform all of the undifferentiated heavy lifting for you.\nIn addition, the pipelines the framework creates can perform functional tests and static analysis on your templates to help you with your SDLC.\nService Catalog Factory allows you to define Service Catalog portfolios and products using YAML. You can version your products and specify where the source code for them can be found.\nYou can configure the frameowrk to publish the portfolios, products and versions in each of your required AWS Regions.\nHigh level architecture diagram You build products in a central hub account using AWS CodePipeline and AWS CodeBuild, you then deploy them into AWS Service Catalog in every enabled region of your hub account using AWS CodePipeline and AWS CloudFormation.\n  User interaction with the Framework is via a YAML file. The YAML file contains the definition of the Portfolios and Products you want to manage. Updates to the YAML file in AWS CodeCommit triggers the AWS CodePipeline to manage execute the tasks required.\n"

To bring down costs, the customer has purchased a set of EC2 reserved instances, based on common workload profiles, and we need to ensure the teams are using them for long running applications.\nTo help the customer, we will design and then deploy a control that gives them visibility into which EC2 instance types are being used within an AWS account.\nThe plan We are going to create and deploy a governance control using an AWS Config managed rule to ensure the right instance types are being used.\nYou can follow these steps to do this:\n Create the control   Provision the control   Future work will involve mandating that teams use only approved instance types.
