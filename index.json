AWS Service Catalog Service allows organizations to create and manage catalogs of IT services that are approved for use on AWS.\nThese IT services can include everything from virtual machine images, servers, software, and databases to complete multi-tier application architectures. AWS Service Catalog allows you to centrally manage commonly deployed IT services, and helps you achieve consistent governance and meet your compliance requirements, while enabling users to quickly deploy only the approved IT services they need.\n NOTE: Whilst this Workshop makes use of AWS Service Catalog, the primary goal is to learn how to use a suite of open source tools created to compliment the native AWS service.\n "

You will also need to decide which account to install these tools into.\nThis account will contain the AWS CodePipelines and will need to be accessible to any accounts you would like to share products with. If you want to use the optional AWS Organizations support you will need to install the tools into an account where there is (or can be) a trust relationship with the Organizations master account. You can install these tools into your master account but this is not recommended.\nBoth tools should be installed into the same region of the same account.\nTask list Here:\n Service Catalog Factory   Service Catalog Puppet   "

You specify where in git the source code is for your products and you specify which regions you would like your products to exist and the framework will perform all of the undifferentiated heavy lifting for you.\nIn addition, the pipelines the framework creates can perform functional tests and static analysis on your templates to help you with your SDLC.\nService Catalog Factory allows you to define Service Catalog portfolios and products using YAML. You can version your products and specify where the source code for them can be found.\nYou can configure the frameowrk to publish the portfolios, products and versions in each of your required AWS Regions.\nHigh level architecture diagram You build products in a central hub account using AWS CodePipeline and AWS CodeBuild, you then deploy them into AWS Service Catalog in every enabled region of your hub account using AWS CodePipeline and AWS CloudFormation.\n  User interaction with the Framework is via a YAML file. The YAML file contains the definition of the Portfolios and Products you want to manage. Updates to the YAML file in AWS CodeCommit triggers the AWS CodePipeline to manage execute the tasks required.\n"

To bring down costs, the customer has purchased a set of EC2 reserved instances, based on common workload profiles, and we need to ensure the teams are using them for long running applications.\nTo help the customer, we will design and then deploy a control that gives them visibility into which EC2 instance types are being used within an AWS account.\nThe plan We are going to create and deploy a governance control using an AWS Config managed rule to ensure the right instance types are being used.\nYou can follow these steps to do this:\n Create the control   Provision the control   Future work will involve mandating that teams use only approved instance types.

	"content": " The ask ACME Org now has a number of development and test workloads in AWS. Many of these workloads make use of data storage services such as Amazon RDS and Amazon S3. The customer has recently established a dedicated data governance team, who have been tasked with identifying controls for workloads that process data classified as confidential or internal-use only.\nThe data governance team has recently issued guidelines around the use of encryption for data at rest and in transit in the cloud. We have below an excerpt from the data governance standard:\n 3.1.1 All cloud data storage systems must be configured to support encryption at rest and in transit using industry supported encryption algorithms for data classified as Confidential, or Internal-Use only. For a list of approved encryption algorithms and key-lengths please see Appendix A.\n From these guidelines there are two new requirements:\n The data governance team at ACME Org wants to get visibility into resources where encryption at rest is not being used The team wants to use AWS Service Catalog to make it easy for development teams to comply with the encryption-at-rest requirement, without having to set it up themselves.  These requirements will shape the work that goes into building additional data governance controls as development teams look to use additional AWS services to store production or material data.\nThe plan We are going to create and deploy a data governance control using an AWS Config managed rule to ensure the teams are using encryption when creating an RDS instance. We will then create a self service Service Catalog product so the teams can create compliant resources.\n Create the control   Provision the control   Create the product   If you need help at any time please raise your hand.\n "
