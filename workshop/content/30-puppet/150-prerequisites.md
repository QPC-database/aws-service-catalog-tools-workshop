In order to complete this workshop you will need a single AWS Account and a web browser where 
you can access the AWS console.

If you are using Service Catalog Puppet with Service Catalog Factory you should install the two
tools into the same account.

We also recommend a tasty set of biscuits and a cup of tea!
