Greetings, intrepid builders! You've made it.  Based on your impressive work so far & the technical mastery you've demonstrated,, you have been hired to work with the best and the brightest at ACME. In your new roles as security engineers, you will deliver service catalog products that meet stringent security requirements with ease.

The following tasks will test your mettle as you make your way through dimly lit dungeons, defeat large reptilian creatures, and rescue royalty trapped in castles. Just kidding. You only have to write a little bit of YAML, and see how far you can get with very little code using tools that you  use in your day-to-day jobs.

This is  what've we've done so far:

* ✅ Installed service catalog factory that lets you build AWS Service Catalog portfolios and products
* ✅ Installed service catalog puppet that lets you share AWS Service Catalog products and provision them elsewhere.
* ✅ Made it this far without giving up.

We have three tasks set up for you, each of these tasks requires you to think about security requirements that have been set by ACME Corp (TODO) and build easy to use solutions. You will be provided with code and instructions on how to complete these tasks - but take your time to understand what is going on under the hood, and don't be afraid to ask questions.

The goal of these tasks is to get you familiar with using service catalog tools and understanding how you could build a workflow around creation and deployment of AWS Service Catalog products with security and governance requirements in mind.

Don't worry if you cannot complete all the assigned tasks during the workshop, you can complete them in your own time, using your own AWS account.
