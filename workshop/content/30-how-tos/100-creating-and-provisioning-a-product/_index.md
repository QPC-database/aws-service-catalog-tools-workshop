We are going to create an AWS Service Catalog product and provision it into our account.  This product will enable AWS
Config.

To do this we will need to use Service Catalog factory to build the product and then we will use Service Catalog
puppet to provision it into the designated account.

This task should give you an understanding of how the service catalog tools are used to both create and then provision 
AWS Service Catalog products. We'll build on this knowledge in subsequent tasks.
