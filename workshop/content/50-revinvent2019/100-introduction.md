Thank you for joining us here at ACME. A few words from our Chief Information Security Officer (CISO):

>We are a regulated industry that believes that security is job zero and is crucial to building new capabilities in the cloud, and we are excited to have you on board as an aspiring security engineer. Over the next few years, we're looking to move our most sensitive workloads to the cloud and we want to ensure that we can enable our development teams to build with security guardrails in place. Doing this will help us move fast, but also ensure that we meet our commitments to our regulators, our internal security controls functions, and most importantly ensure that we grow our trusted relationships with customers.

We've created this workshop to introduce you to the open source service catalog tools. Using these tools, you can create and deploy AWS Service Catalog products that comply with security and governance requirements set by our Chief Information Security Office. We hope that users can then use these products to build solutions that comply with our policies by default.

We expect that you have a high level understanding of AWS Service Catalog and that you have an understanding of services such as AWS CodePipeline, AWS CodeCommit, and AWS CodeBuild.

As an aspiring security engineer, we would like you to set up and configure service catalog tools to demonstrate your technical abilities. When you have completed the setup, we'll move on to creating products that meet requirements created by our CISO.

Don't worry if you get stuck - look around the room to find friendly helpers who can help you continue on your journey.
